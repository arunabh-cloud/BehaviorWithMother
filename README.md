# BehaviorWithMother

A series of incidents happened when I was supposed to ask this question: https://literature.stackexchange.com/questions/26273/symbolism-of-the-name-red-rose-in-chapter-8-of-the-scarlet-letter. On Thursday, February 15, 2024, afternoon in NJ, I was supposed to go for a weekly class at the Ridgewood Public Library. But just before going to the class, I tried spending time trying to fix a computer program. When my mom asked my to go to class right away, I started to attack her violently and scream. As a result, she had to confiscate my laptop. I really regret what I did that day. I still had access to my dad's iPad. Then when it was Friday, February 16, 2024, UTC time, I opened my dad's iPad and saw that the Literature site is the Today's Featured Site. I apologized to my mom. On Friday, February 16, 2024, morning in NJ, she asked me to read one chapter from the book of Greek and Roman mythology and asked me to write a summary of the stories. But I spent the full day writing the summary verbatim from the book. So, by the time, I finished writing the summaries, it was already Saturday February 17 in UTC time. So, when my mom gave me the laptop, I decided to change the computer time settings to 4 pm, and I was in a hurry to ask a question on the Literature site.
